### Playwright

In order to run e2e tests you might need to setup playwright to download the used browser versions.
To do this run `pnpm exec playwright install`

If you are running linux and get a warning about missing host system dependencies you can try running
`pnpm exec playwright install-deps` to resolve the issue.
